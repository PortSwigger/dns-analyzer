    This extension allows you to find DNS vulnerabilities in web applications! It requires <a href="https://portswigger.net/burp/releases/professional-community-2022-12-4">Burp Suite v2022.12.4</a> or later.<br>
    An in-depth guide for the DNS Analyzer can be found <a href="https://sec-consult.com/blog/detail/dns-analyzer-finding-dns-vulnerabilities-with-burp-suite/">here</a>.

<h4>Usage</h4>
The basic usage boils down to the following steps:
<ol>
    <li>Click "Copy to Clipboard" to generate and copy a Burp Collaborator domain</li>
    <li>Get something to resolve the generated domain via DNS. For example, by using it:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>as an e-mail domain (e.g., test@[collaborator domain])</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Use it at registrations</li>
            <li>Use it at password resets</li>
            <li>Use it for news-letters</li>
            <li>...</li>
        </ul>
        <li>via SSRF</li>
        <li>anywhere, where the collaborator domain gets resolved via DNS</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Analyze the DNS name resolution by selecting DNS interactions in the table</li>
    <li>...</li>
    <li>Profit</li>
</ol>
